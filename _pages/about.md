欢迎来到我的个人主页。

## 个人介绍
Currently I am studying in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Nanjing University. My research area is semi-supervised learning, including but not limited to semi-supervised classification or medical semi-supervised learning. My research work includes how to solve the model collapse problem of semi-supervised models with very few labels, and how to improve the training efficiency of semi-supervised models. 

During his undergraduate years, he formed a team to design and complete projects such as "Intelligent Body Domain Network", and won more than ten awards at the university level and above. During the postgraduate period, he participated in many projects with hospitals and enterprises, and was responsible for data processing, analysis, model building and other tasks.

If we share the same area of research, I very much look forward to interacting with you.
